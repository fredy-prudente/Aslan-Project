        <h1>Discovery</h1>
        <p>When searching for potentially habitable exoplanets, it is helpful to start with worlds similar to ours. But what does "similar" mean? Many rocky planets have been detected in the Earth-sized range: a point in favor of possible life, hence the similarity factor. Many of these planets are located in the zone we call habitable of their system.</p>
        <p>What would be the habitable zone? Its definition of "habitable zone" is the distance from a star at which liquid water could exist on the surfaces of planets in orbit. Habitable zones are also known as Goldilocks zones, where conditions can be ideal neither too hot nor too cold for life.</p>

        <p>Planets around nearby stars are easier to track with larger telescopes in space and on Earth. Discovering a new planet is an important scientific discovery for the community. Confirming the planet's size and habitable zone status with space telescopes is another win for the search for life as we approach more results.</p>

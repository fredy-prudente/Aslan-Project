        <h1>Life Estimate</h1>
        <p>The Drake equation is a mathematical estimate of the number of active extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way. The equation is based on seven parameters, each of which is represented by a letter:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>N: The number of stars in the Milky Way.</li>
            <li>R: The rate of planet formation around stars similar to the Sun.</li>
            <li>fp: The fraction of planets around stars similar to the Sun that have habitable conditions.</li>
            <li>ne: The average number of habitable planets around a star similar to the Sun that can support life.</li>
            <li>fl: The fraction of habitable planets that develop life.</li>
            <li>fi: The fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent civilizations.</li>
            <li>fc: The fraction of intelligent civilizations that develop communication technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By substituting equivalent values into the Drake equation, we obtain an estimated value of 10 planets for the number of active extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way that could have developed on similar planets.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the Drake equation is only an estimate, and that the actual value of the number of active extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way could be much larger or smaller. However, the fact that the planet orbits a star similar to the Sun and is within the habitable zone of the star suggests that the planet has a significant potential for the development of life.</p>

        <p>Planets around nearby stars are easier to track with larger telescopes in space and on Earth. Discovering a new planet is an important scientific discovery for the community. Confirming the planet's size and habitable zone status with space telescopes is another win for the search for life as we approach more results.</p>

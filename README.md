# The Aslan Project
Hackathon Nasa Space Apps Challenge 2023 - Habitable Exoplanets: Creating Worlds Beyond Our Own

The Aslan Project is a website designed to create a habitable environment, considering factors such as atmosphere, civilization, planetary history, estimated lifespan, and distance from its parent star. The central goal of this initiative was to conceive a realistic narrative, even within the context of science fiction. To achieve maximum scientific authenticity, we extensively used data provided by NASA, which encompasses information about planets that may possibly sustain life.

The website functions as a comprehensive compendium about the planet Aslan, addressing everything from its initial discovery to scientific data, the dominant species, culture, and religion of the fictional world. On the homepage, the planet is presented in rotation, inviting visitors to explore more details about it. By clicking on the exploration button, users can access a menu of options, where the rotating planet occupies the center of visual focus. This menu has six buttons, three on each side, which correspond to specific knowledge topics. By clicking on each of these buttons, visitors are directed to static HTML and CSS pages, which delve into the topics with the help of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), carefully crafted to be coherent and complementary to each other.

In terms of benefits, we highlight the ability to use real scientific data to speculate about the existence of life on other planets and the opportunity to create a narrative that balances creativity and scientific rigor. This project provided a wide range of knowledge, from basic notions of temperature to probabilistic concepts, such as the famous Drake Equation.

Our main aspiration was to develop an educational, engaging, and dynamic resource that told a fascinating story. We aim to involve people in creative exploration, educational content production, and understanding the vast universe that surrounds us.

The website design began with paper sketches, aiming for approval from project members. This collective approach facilitated the programming process, minimizing testing and ensuring a shared vision. We used a base of web technologies, including HTML and CSS, to create static websites that apply UX (user experience) principles to make the content accessible to any audience. We invested considerably in design aspects and attractive visual effects, aiming to provide a satisfying experience for users. Our tools included Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, GitHub, and AI played a key role in creating images that illustrate and bring to life the vision of our fictional planet. The emphasis was on ensuring that all images were cohesive and seamlessly integrated into the same fictional world that we conceived.
